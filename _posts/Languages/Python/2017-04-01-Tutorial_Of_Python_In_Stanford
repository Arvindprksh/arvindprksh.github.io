# Tutorial of Python in Stanford university 

This is just arragement and rewritten for my python study, So If I have a problem in document, let me know about it

and then I will erase this later on. 

in order for me to be used to python, Just type the tutorial of stanford. 

So if you want to know more detail of python. just let you know you need to read [this paper(my tutorial with jump to python)](https://hyunyoung2.github.io/2017/03/30/Jump_to_python_tutorial/) that I wrote. 

In here, Just I will only arrange the tutorial of python, not numpy. 

I mean this is just the basic Python
