I saw [a certain site](http://pinkwink.kr/815) explaining how to draw the vectors with matplotlib of python. 

while I was reading the [above site](http://pinkwink.kr/815), I felt interested in the jupyter. Fortunately, I found [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) that is web application for python interpreter. 

So In here, I will explain a little about jupyter. You can also find out an example of jupyter notebook in [this site](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book)


## How to install jupyter 

On window 10 :

"pip install ipython[all]" OR "pip install ipython"

> pip install ipython[all] : everything related to ipython is installed.

OR 

The following is what I recommend to you about installation of jupyter notebook : 

"pip install jupyter"

I recommed you for installing juypter that the above is how you can install jupyter. 


**if you want to execute jupyter**


"jupyter notebook"


if you enter the above command in cmd window. 

in cmd window :

you will get this wab page.

lastly, You can do programming in jupyter and also see graph and result at once.

Also you can share the jupyter file, extension of ipynb.

That way is so easy.

In the above searching window, If you enter the address where your ipynb is placed. you would get the result of executing jupyter as follows.

If you want to see the above jupyter nbviewer, click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hyunyoung2/hyunyoung2.github.io/blob/master/img/Image/Languages/Python/2017-05-15-Jupyter_Notebook/Jupyter%20test%20with%20matplotlib.ipynb).

After finding this jupyter, I will use this tool for python coding. 

So If you want to know the brief information about how to use ipython notebokk (more recently known as jupyter notebook).

Just click [this site, ipython tutorial of Stanford 231 n.](http://cs231n.github.io/ipython-tutorial/) 


**But, The easiest way to install juypter is use of Anaconda.** 

Let's go to [jupyter.org](http://jupyter.org) to look for way to install Anaconda
