I saw [a cetain site](http://pinkwink.kr/815) about explaining how to draw the vectors with matplotlib of python. 

and while I was reading the [above site](http://pinkwink.kr/815), Fortunately, I found [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) that is web application for python interpreter. 

So In here, I will explain a little about jupyter. You can also find out an example of jupyter notebook in [this site](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book)


## How to install jupyter 

On window 10 :

"pip install ipython[all]" OR "pip install ipython"

> pip install ipython[all] : everything related to ipython is installed.

OR 

The following is what I recommend to you about installation of jupyter notebook : 

"pip install jupyter"

lastly, You can do programming in jupyter and also see graph and result at once.

Also you can share the jupyter file, extension of ipyn.

BUT if you want to use nbviewer, you have to install jupyter_contrib_extension as indicating on [git-hub](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions)

After finding this jupyter, I will use this tool for python coding.
