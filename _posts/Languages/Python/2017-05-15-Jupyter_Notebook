I saw [a cetain site](http://pinkwink.kr/815) about explaining how to draw the vectors with matplotlib of python. 

and while I was reading the [above site](http://pinkwink.kr/815), Fortunately, I found [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) that is web application for python interpreter. 

So In here, I will explain a little about jupyter. You can also find out an example of jupyter notebook in [this site](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book)


## How to install jupyter 

On window 10 :

"pip install ipython[all]" OR "pip install ipython"

> pip install ipython[all] : everything related to ipython is installed. 

![]()

OR 

"pip install jupyter"

![]()


I recommed you for installing juypter that the above is how you can install jupyter. 


**if you want to execute jupyter**


"jupyter notebook"






After finding this jupyter, I will use this tool for python coding.
