I am going to try to arrange something that I've studied to make OpenAPI for my OpenSource project. 


# [What is the API?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)

 API is short for "Application programming interface." It is the same to call library when you are programming. 
 
 Let's say you want to make function to copy the string from one to another place. If you are c programmer user, 
 
 You are going to call **strcpy** or **strncpy** function. That is to say, API move calling function to application to do a particular functionality.
 
 i.e. calling library is totally the same from saying "the programmer are using API" 
 
 just depend on environment where you develope program like web, operating systems, and a certain framework.
 
 If you want to know detail. go to [the wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)
