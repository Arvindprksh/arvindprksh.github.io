I made this tutorial of python based on ["Jump to Python", open-book](https://wikidocs.net/book/1).

Just this is for programmers who have a variety of experience of differenct language but not python. 

But If you have a knowledge about different programming languages. You could understand this post of Python tutorial. 

Note that I wrote this article based on what I understand about python, comparing it with what I have on C++/C language.

You have to think on Python, everything is object. I think that is basic concept on python. 

But Frankly speaking, you don't need to consider this concept if you want to be beginner, but, If you want to be intermediate and more. 

I recommend you python consists of object. whatever type!

**Python consists of Object, So If you have time, use "getrefcount()", function of python.**

Let's start basic type of python.
