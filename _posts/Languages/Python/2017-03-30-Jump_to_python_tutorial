I made this tutorial of python based on ["Jump to Python", open-book](https://wikidocs.net/book/1).

Just this is for programmers who have a variety of experience of differenct language. 

But If you have a knowledge a little about different programming languages. You could understand this post of Python tutorial. 

Note that I wrote this article based on what I understand about python, comparing it with what I understand on C++/C language.

**Before you read this article, You have to keep in mind about several things.**

**In Python, everything is object, instance of class. especially above Python 3.x.**

In other words, even integer is object above Python 3.x.

---

**BUT,** If you are beginner of Python, You don't need to consider this concept. however, If you want to be intermediat.

Keep in mind, "Everything of Python is Object, instance of Class"

Indirectly, You can check it up about what I wrote above. 

**use getrefcount() function in sys module**

**If you can know whether I write what I understand on Python or not, Please let me know what's wrong as tutorial of Python.**

And then, I will fix it as you know me after I check it up. 

If you know me, I really appreciate it!!

# Tutorial Of python With [Jump to python,Open-book](https://wikidocs.net/book/1)

Python has effective approach to object-oriented Programming. 

And the features of the Python are dynamically typed language and multi-paradigm programming language. 

So you can code source like many ways for Object-oriented Programming, strucural programming, and functional Programming.  

**remember ! Basicaly in jump to python, the version of Python is above 3.0. basically they use 3.0 version python.**

what kind of data type do python have?

**But this tutorial will be made on Python 2.7.5 that I have On my CentOS.**

## Basic data type

##### Numberic : This data type is similar to primitive type of C, C++ language or JAVA. i.e,BUT one is different from those languages, that is when you want to change primitive type to object type. Normally, you use the **wrapper class** in java. just think of this type in python like it. i.e numeric is also object in python.

Let's see the sampe code 




##### String :

##### Boolean :


## High-level data type

##### List

##### Tuple

##### Dictionary

##### Set

## Statement

##### If

##### While

##### for

## Function


## class


## Module


## Package


## Exception


## Inner Function & Outer Function

       - This site is actually I'm not refer to it When I wrote this article, tutorial of Jump to python. just later on, I think this will be useful site. So in order to remember this site. 
       
       - I wrote here as Reference. 
       
  - Also, the two sites above is in Korean, So If you want to know python, I won't recommend this site.
  
  - Strongly to you, I recommend this site, [tutorial of Python in Officail python site](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/),
  
  - In spite of Korean languages. If you want to read the site, Jump to Python. Just recommend you use the google translator.
