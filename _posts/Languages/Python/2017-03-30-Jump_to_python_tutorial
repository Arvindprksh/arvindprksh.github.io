I made this tutorial of python based on ["Jump to Python", open-book](https://wikidocs.net/book/1).

Just this is for programmers who have a variety of experience of differenct language. 

But If you have a knowledge a little about different programming languages. You could understand this post of Python tutorial. 

Note that I wrote this article based on what I understand about python, comparing it with what I understand on C++/C language.

**Before you read this article, You have to keep in mind about several things.**

**In Python, everything is object, instance of class. especially above Python 3.x.**

In other words, even integer is object above Python 3.x.

**BUT,** If you are beginner of Python, You don't need to consider this concept. however, If you want to be intermediat.

Keep in mind, "Everything of Python is Object, instance of Class"

Indirectly, You can check it up about what I wrote above. 

**use getrefcount() function in sys module**

**If you can know whether I write what I understand on Python or not, Please let me know what's wrong as tutorial of Python.**

And then, I will fix it as you know me after I check it up. 

If you know me, I really appreciate it!!
