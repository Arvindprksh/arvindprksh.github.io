# Tutorial of Numpy

This is based on stanford tutorial of python 

in here, we will look over Numpy Linbrary of python. 

If you know this Library, You will have a powerful skill about scientific computing!

So if you find something wrong in here. let me know to fix it.

Ahead of progressing Numpy, If you're not used to python, 

I recommend you to read the followings :
