First of all, If you use scala interpreter without the complicated installation process. 

I recommend you two ways to use scala interpreter. 


# Get Scala

1. On-line

  Go to the [https://scalafiddle.io/](https://scalafiddle.io/)
  
  test with println("Hellow world !") in the left side. 
  
  press "Run" button


2. Off-line on you local machine

  go to the [http://www.scala-lang.org/download/](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/)
  
  and then you need to download binary file for scala
  
  after that in bin directory, "./scala"
  
  at that time, you can use scala interperter.
