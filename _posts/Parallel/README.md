# Parallel

  After I studied stanford lecture about deeplearing, CS231, CS224n. I think I need some knowledge like parallel. 
  
  Finally, I found out the good lecture on online in Udacity, [Learn parallel programming with NVIDIA](https://blog.udacity.com/?s=parallel).
  
  I tried to organize What I learn from the class in here Whenever I study it.
