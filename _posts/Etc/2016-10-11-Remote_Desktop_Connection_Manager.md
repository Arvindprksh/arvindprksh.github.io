 I will explain what i understand. 
 
 First, you want to access to remote desktop. 
 
 The above picuter show you what you need. 
 
 **Sever name mean IP address of server or maybe domain**
 
 because Domain is eqaul to IP address. 
 
 **User name is ID of your account of remote computer**
 
 **Password is literally passwod of your account of remote computer to access**
 
 I think domain is domain concept of network. namely, in network, each domain is mapped to IP address by DNS. 
 
 **So, Domain is literally Domain about Ip Address of remote desktop for me to access.**
