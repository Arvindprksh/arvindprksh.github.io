**This pase is summary of my class of Advancee Topics in computer science about MinHashing for Security Field's file similarity.**

Before going through Minhashing, arrange the background information like 

- What is the metric for whether data poits (X1, X2, ...) in high dimensional space is similar or not?

The metric is distance, so We need the definition which quantifies the **distance** between X1 and X2. 

i.e. finding all pairs of data point(Xi, Xj) that are within some distance threshold d(X1, X2) <= S(threshold)

When finding all paris of data point against data point Xi which is near-neighbor, it takes O(N^2). 

 - N is the number of data point.

here distance metric means Jaccard distance and similarity, The relationship between Jaccard distance and Jaccard similarity is :

> D(C1, C2) = 1 - Sim(C1, C2)

 - C1, C2 : set 

 - D(C1, C2) : Jaccard distance in the figuer below
 
 - Sim(C1, C2): Jaccard similarity(Index) in the figure below - in two sets, The size of their intersection divided by the size of their union.

Let's see an example:

![](img/Image/Graduate_school/Security/2018-10-11-Min_Hashing/Jaccard_similairity_example.png)

As you can see above, Jaccard similarity is 3/8. 

3 is intersection set and  8 is union set. 

** Keep in mind set is no-duplicate ***

## Shingles

For now, We know What is distance and similairity metric on relationship of set. 

Let's see how to covert document to sets.

The simple way is : 

 - Document is the set of words appearing in document.
 
So we could represent the document as set of **important** words.

But There are problems which is what is the standard of importance and the set of important words ignore the ordering of words. 

Shingle accounts for The ordering of words. 

a K-Shingle (or K-gram) for a document si a sequence of K tokens that appear in the document.

 - Tokens can be characters, words or something else, depending on the application. 
 
Let's suppose here tokens is characters. 

> K=2 , document D1 = abcab

 - Set of 2-shingles: S(D1) = {ab, bc, ca}
 
 - But bag of 2-shingles: S`(D1) = {ab, bc, ca, ab}, count ab twice. 

From now on, We utilize Set of shigles for Minhashing.
