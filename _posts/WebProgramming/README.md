# WebProgramming 

This directory is my organization that I did whenever I do web programming. 

Currently, in order to design my blog futher than initial version of this blog.

This folder includes a little bit information about what I have done on [my hynyoung2 blog](https://hyunyoung2.github.io/) 

For example, tag, category countings, google customizing search engine, and basic syntax about Markdown. and so on. 

If you want to know how to design static page based on jekyll, 

I recommend you slightly to read this article on [my **hynyoung2 blog** explaning what I have done.](https://hyunyoung2.github.io/alistofcategories/#web-programming) 

Futhermore, only If I study webprogramming. I will try to upload my information to share it to other people.
