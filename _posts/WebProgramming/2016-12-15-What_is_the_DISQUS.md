## what is the DISQUS ?

  What I know about DISQUS is add-on tools to make site owners to power discussion, increase engagement, and earn revenue. 
  
  BUT in my case, I will use discussion function.
  
  if you use beautiful-jekyll, after changing the option related to DISQUS, you can use Disqus. 
  
  code to run disqus is already made in beautiful-jekyll using ruby. 
  
  If you are thiking how they make it, click [beautiful-jekyll site](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll)
  
  first, you sign up [DISQUS site](https://disqus.com/)
  
  the image below shows you appearance after changing option.
