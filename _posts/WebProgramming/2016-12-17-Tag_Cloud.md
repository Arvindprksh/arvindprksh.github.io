## Tag Cloud
 
   ![](/img/Image/WebProgramming/2016-12-17-Tag_Cloud/word cloud.png)
   
   As you can see the above image, I will make it for my gitpage for me to help search for my posts.
   
   BUT My tag cloud will not be fancy like the above thing, Because I'm not expert of web developing. 
   
   I am newbie of webprogramming. but because I need to that functionality, I just try to make it. 
   
   So, after seeing how to make tag cloud, you can also make category cloud. that is because the logic that make cloud is the same. 
 
   let's start making cloud of tags without plugin.
 
   GitHub builds Jekyll sites with safe option which allows only a few plugs (such as sitemap) to be include 
   
   One distinct feature of cloud is how to fit the size of tag, according to the number of posts that are marked with that tag
   
   first, let's see front matter of jekyll post, when I make a post, you configure for your post. 
 
```

category: Web programming
tags: [jekyll]

```   

  As you can see the above, when we make tag cloud. we use the tags(jekyll) 
   
  Keep in mind, you have to specify tags on your posts, after that, you can generate tag cloud. 
   
  let's see how to generate tags cloud! 
   
  below is example code from [superdevresources blog](https://superdevresources.com/tag-cloud-jekyll/) 

  <script src="https://gist.github.com/hyunyoung2/68791d45c085ee36f86ca8ae50ab79ae.js"></script>

 if you make page(.html, .md) with the above code, you can see the word cloud like this 
   
   ![](/img/Image/WebProgramming/2016-12-17-Tag_Cloud/Word cloud example.png)
   
   in the code, "assign tags = site.tags \| sort" means sorting tags alphabetically. 
   
   if you don't use "assign tags = site.tags \| sort", tags is not sorted alphabetically.
   
```
tag | last | size  |  times: 4 | plus: 80  in % unit
```
   
   Also this part is key point to resize the number of tags. 
   
   BUT, there is another way like this just adding "divided_by: site.tag.size" !

```
tag | last | size  |  times: 100 | divided_by: site.tag.size | plus: 70  in % unit
```

   Exactly,  I don't know what "divided_by: site.tag.size" means yet
   
   maybe If you know that, "divided_by: site.tag.size", when you read this. 
   
   pleas let me know about meaning of it.

  But, If you want categories cloud, just chagne the tags --> categories like this

  <script src="https://gist.github.com/hyunyoung2/f6655ca85e8af71bc2ec3ed14308522a.js"></script>

  Then, you can get categories cloud. i.e "for tags in site.tags" to "for tags in site.categories"

  From now on, let's see my code of categories cloud. 
  
  here is [the example site](/alistofcategories/)
  
  the actual code of my gitpage :
  
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/hyunyoung2/5a205be4f7456ad75597e6bc8ffbd279.js"></script>
  
  As you can see the code. If you want to make cloud system on your gitpage with the above code. 
  
  make page to copy and paste the above. 
  
  then You will get the cloud system based on categories. but,  it might be a little different. that is becuase you and I are different about css. 
  
  let's see my code again. 
  
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/hyunyoung2/4862d8e47f823c57efe960772ab5131a.js"></script>
  
  this portion is just about resizing the number of categories and extracting categories in posts. 
  
  And another part is making a list of items that each categories includes. 
  
  the following is what i explained to you, 
  
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/hyunyoung2/d1e80cdbef4efd7419a5a250dc854bce.js"></script>
