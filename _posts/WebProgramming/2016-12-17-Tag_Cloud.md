## Tag Cloud
 
   ![](/img/Image/WebProgramming/2016-12-17-Tag_Cloud/word cloud.png)
   
   As you can see the above image, I will make it for my gitpage for me to help search for my posts.
   
   But My tag cloud is not fancy like the above thing, Because I'm not expert of web developing. 
   
   I am newbie, but because I need to that functionality, I will just try to make it. 
   
   So, after seeing how to make tag cloud, you also can make category cloud. the logic is the same. 
 
   let's start making cloud of tags
 
   GitHub builds Jekyll sites with safe option which allows only a few plugs (such as sitemap) to be include 
   
   One distinct feature of cloud is how to fit the size of tag, according to the number of posts that are marked with that tag
   
   first, let's see front matter of jekyll post 
   
 ```markdown 
 ---
 layout: post
 title: ~~~~~~~~
 subtitle: ~~~~~~~~
 category: Web programming
 tags: [jekyll]
 ---
 ```

   As you can see the above, when we make tag cloud. we use the tags(jekyll) 
   
   Keep in mind, you have to specify tags on your posts, after that, you can generate tag cloud. 
   
   let's see how to generate tags cloud! 
   
   below is example code from [superdevresources blog](https://superdevresources.com/tag-cloud-jekyll/) 
   
   <script src="https://gist.github.com/hyunyoung2/68791d45c085ee36f86ca8ae50ab79ae.js"></script>

   if you make page(.html, .md) with the above code, you can see the word cloud like this 
   
   ![](/img/Image/WebProgramming/2016-12-17-Tag_Cloud/Word cloud example.png)
   
```markdown
  assign tags = site.tags | sort 
```

   this code is tags variable get sorted tags in alphabetical order on your posts. 
   
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/hyunyoung2/a192fe4432ee54346a6611f33bfe4d07.js"></script> 

   And this part is to resize and extract tags to fit the number of tags in posts.
   
```markdwon 
style="font-size: {{ tag | last | size  |  times: 4 | plus: 80  }}%"
```
  
   i.e key point to resize tag to fit the number of each tags the abov code ! 
   
   this portion adjusts the size of font automatically.
   
   And another way exist. let's see below
   
```markdown 
{{ tag | last | size | times: 100 | divided_by: site.tag.size | plus: 70 }}
```

  Exactly, I don't know what the above code means, 
  
  why does "divided_by: site.tag.size" need to control the size of tags ? 
  
  if you know about this, could you explain to me about this ?
  
  I seriously will appreciate it !!
  
  Now you can make frame of tag cloud with example that I show you in the front, And If you change the tags into categories. 
  
  that is category cloud.
 
  specifically, If you change the code as follows. You can get cloud of categories. 
 
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/hyunyoung2/f6655ca85e8af71bc2ec3ed14308522a.js"></script>

  The following is example of categories cloud.
 
```  
  for tags in site.tags ---> for tags in site.categories
```

  From now on, I will explain to you that I made categories cloud with tags-based cloud. 
  
  First let's see [my example]("{{ site.baseurl }}/alistofcategories").
  
  The example is based on Categories.
  
  let's see my code for categories cloud. 
  
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/hyunyoung2/5a205be4f7456ad75597e6bc8ffbd279.js"></script>
 
  as you can see the code. If you want to make categories cloude, 
 
  First of all, make page to generate cloud of categories !
  
  Second of all, You have to copy and paste the above code 
 
  But If you want to tags cloud, just do it like below. 
 
```ruby
 - assign tags = site.categories | sort  --->  assign tags = site.tags | sort 
```

  for tags cloud, that's it! it's so easy to make tags cloud.
  
  let's see my code again.
  
  First of all, Cloud of categories. 
  
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/hyunyoung2/4862d8e47f823c57efe960772ab5131a.js"></script>

   As you can see the code, in my code, Firts, catergories is sorted. and then, the number of each categories is resized. 
   
   the following is a protion for me to calculate the number of categories.
   
```html
style="font-size: {{ tag | last | size  |  times: 4 | plus: 80  }}%"
```
  this is a important portion to resize the category icon in my gitpage.
  
  And the rest of my code is used to make a list for each categries.
  
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/hyunyoung2/d1e80cdbef4efd7419a5a250dc854bce.js"></script>

   As you can see the code, the above code shows you how to list items of categories 
   
   the following is example of using the above.
