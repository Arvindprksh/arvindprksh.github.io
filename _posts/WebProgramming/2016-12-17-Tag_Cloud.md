   As you can see the above image, I will make it for my gitpage for me to help search for my posts.
   
   BUT My tag cloud will not be fancy like the above thing, Because I'm not expert of web developing. 
   
   I am newbie of webprogramming. but because I need to that functionality, I just try to make it. 
   
   So, after seeing how to make tag cloud, you can also make category cloud. that is because the logic that make cloud is the same. 
 
   let's start making cloud of tags without plugin.

   first, let's see front matter of jekyll post, when I make a post, you configure for your post.
