 ## Tag Cloud
 
   ![](/img/Image/WebProgramming/2016-12-17-Tag_Cloud/word cloud.png)
   
   As you can see the above image, I will make it for my gitpage for me to search for my posts.
   
   But My tag cloude is not fancy like the above thing, I'm not expert of web developing. 
   
   I am newbie, but as software engineer, because I need to that functionality, I will try to make it. 
   
   if you can make tag cloud, you also can make category cloud. the logic is the same. 
 
   GitHub builds Jekyll sites with safe option which allows only a few plugs (such as sitemap) to be include 
   
   One distinct feature of cloud is how to fit the size of tag, according to the number of posts that are marked with that tag
   
   first, let's see front matter of jekyll post 
   
 ```markdown

   As you can see the above, when we make tag cloud. we use the tags(jekyll) 
   
   Keep in mind, when you have to specify tags on your posts, if you want to generate tag cloud. 
   
   let's see how to generate tags cloud! 
   
   below is example code. 
   
```markdown
{% assign tags = site.tags | sort %}
{% for tag in tags %}
 <span class="site-tag">
    <a href="/tag/{{ tag | first | slugify }}/"
        style="font-size: {{ tag | last | size  |  times: 4 | plus: 80  }}%">
            {{ tag[0] | replace:'-', ' ' }} ({{ tag | last | size }})
    </a>
</span>
{% endfor %}
```
   if you make page(.html, .md) with the above code, you can see the word cloud like this 
   
   ![](/img/Image/WebProgramming/2016-12-17-Tag_Cloud/Word cloud example.png)
   
```markdown
{% assign tags = site.tags | sort %}
```
   this code is tags variable get sorted tags in your posts. 
  
   On the above code, If you change a portion :
   
```markdown   
   <a href="/tag/{{ tag | first | slugify }}/" -->  <a href="/tag/{{ tag | first | slugize }}/"
```
   tags will appear vertically unlike the above image. 
   
   that is becuase of <il></il>.
   
```markdown   
{% for tag in site.tags %}
    <li style="font-size: {{ tag | last | size | times: 4 | plus: 80 }}%">
        <a href="/{{ tag | first | slugize }}/">
            {{ tag | first }}
        </a>
    </li> 
{% endfor %} 
```   
   
   And this part is to fit the size of tag with the number of posts.
   
```markdwon 
   style="font-size: {{ tag | last | size  |  times: 4 | plus: 80  }}%">
```
   this portion adjusts the size of font automatically.
   
   And another way exist. let's see below
   
``` markdown 
{{ tag | last | size | times: 100 | divided_by: site.tag.size | plus: 70 }}
```

  Excatly I don't know what is differenct between two cases. 
  
  If you know about that, let me know what is different between both cases.
 
  I seriously will appreciate it !!
  
  Now you can make frame of tag cloud, In the above code, If you change the tags into categories. 
  
  that is category cloud as follows
  
```
{% assign categories = site.categories | sort %}
{% for category in categories %}
 <span class="site-tag">
    <a href="/category/{{ category | first | slugify }}/"
        style="font-size: {{ category | last | size  |  times: 4 | plus: 80  }}%">
            {{ tag[0] | replace:'-', ' ' }} ({{ category | last | size }})
    </a>
</span>
{% endfor %}
```

  later on, I will integrate this with table of content
