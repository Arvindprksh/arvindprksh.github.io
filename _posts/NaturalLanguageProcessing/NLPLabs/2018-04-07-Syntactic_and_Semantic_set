After I read the paper, Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space titled.

I think I need to make the test set of syntactic and semantic qeustion into another language.

In particular, I want to translate the test set into Korean language. Becuase I am researcher of Korean language NLP. 

But If you guys use this respository I store with work I did. you can translate the test set into another language including language set the module, googletrans is providing. 


First, git clone the Hyunyoung2 [Korean test set v1](https://github.com/hyunyoung2/Hyunyoung2_Korean_test_set_v1)

and then run **Download_test_set.sh** under the English directory. 

you will get the text file, word-test.v1.txt like this:

> ./Download_test_set.sh

Second, run the python script, **google_trans.py**.

> python3 google_trans.py

In my case, I normally use python3, so I run the python script above with python3. 

If you want to see the code, You could check [my repository](https://github.com/hyunyoung2/Hyunyoung2_Korean_test_set_v1)

just I did programming on **google_trans.py**, I verified the python script with [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/)

The following is just information about using pylint. 

- with pip3 install pylint, i.e. python package for python3

- with apt-get install pylint i.e. ubuntu package

![](/img/Image/NaturalLanguageProcessing/NLPLabs/2018-04-07-Syntactic_and_Semantic_set/ubuntu_apt_pylint2.png)

Finally, after running the python script, **google_trans.py**, the result is as follows:

![](/img/Image/NaturalLanguageProcessing/NLPLabs/2018-04-07-Syntactic_and_Semantic_set/Korean_word_test_v1.png)

After I finished this job, I think that has error on syntactic qeustions, Later I have to fix this data of syntactic question to Korean Language.
