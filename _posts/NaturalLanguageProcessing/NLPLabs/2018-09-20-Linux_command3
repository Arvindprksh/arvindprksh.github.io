# wget utility and curl

The **wget utility** allows you to download we pages, files and images from the web using Linux command line.

 > wget -c URL_or_IP_Address_of_what_you_want_to_download

The **curl ** is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocoals.

 > curl -O URL_or_IP_Address_of_what_you_want_to_download
 
In more detailed, Let's say, If you want to Fetch the file **index.html** from a certain URL using HTTP protocol.
and display it to standard output. it is similar to view the source of the webpage, I mean the following will display the raw HTML

> curl a_certain_URL/index.html

After fetching the same file as above, but If you want to redirect the output to a file, index_file, in the current directory.

type in like this:

> curl a_certain_URL/index.html > index_file

If you want to output a file with the same name(index.html) in the current directory, this time use curl command with **-O** option like this:

> curl -O curl a_certain_URL/index.html
