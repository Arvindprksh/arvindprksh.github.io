This is a brief summary of paper for me to study and organize it, [Neural Summarization by Extracting Sentences and Words. Cheng and Lapata. ACL 2016](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1046/) I read and studied. 
{% include MathJax.html %}

This paper proposed an extractive summarization method based on neuaral networks.

The extractive unit is two types, one is the sentence and the other is word.

For sentence, extractive summarization method select sentences in a document as summary. 

Normally, research of it was consider sequence labeling task to choose sentences in a document 

Let's see an example data

First of all, sentence extractor is as following:

Finally, Word extractor,which is the extracted unit change from sentence to word , is as following:

on evaluation, they used ROUGE-1,2 as means of assessing informativeness and the longest common subsequences(ROUGE-L) as a means of assessing fluency.

Traditional approaches to extractive summarization rely heavily on humanengineered features. In this work they propose a data-driven approach based on neural networks and continuous sentence features. They develop a general framework for single-document summarization composed of a hierarchical document encoder and an attention-based extractor. This architecture allows them to develop different classes of summarization models which can extract sentences or words.
