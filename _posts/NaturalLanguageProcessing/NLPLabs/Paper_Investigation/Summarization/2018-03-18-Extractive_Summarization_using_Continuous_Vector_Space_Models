This paper is related to how to summarize document in the way to well extract sentence from input sentences using continuous vector representaion.

But I think this paper helps me understand the architecture base on neural newwork language modeling.  

For example, Feed-forwar neural network, Auto-Encoder, and recursive neural network. 

Also, this paper explain how to make sentence vector or phrase vector. 

This ideas is so fundanmental way. But with regard to word embedding and phrase embedding, this paper simply explained to me. 

i.e. This paper is about explaining extract some sentence to similar summarization of document using word embedding and phrase embedding.


<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note: </b>
This paper explained how to well extract some sentences to summarize a set of multi-document using word embedding and phrase embedding.
Also basic explanation about word embedding is easy to understand to me. I mean explaining basic concept of FFNN, RvNN, and AE makes me easily understand them.
