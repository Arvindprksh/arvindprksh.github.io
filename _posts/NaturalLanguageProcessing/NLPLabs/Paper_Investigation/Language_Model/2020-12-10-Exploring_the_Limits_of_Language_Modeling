This is a brief summary of paper for me to study and organize it, [Exploring the Limits of Language Modeling (Jozefowicz et al., arXiv 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02410) that I read and studied. 
{% include MathJax.html %}

They fouced on neural network-based language models to explore the limits of them on the popular One Billion Word Benchmark.



For their expriments, the architectures that they considered is representede in figure below:

They propose a softmax over large vocabularies to go through similarity and difference between Noise Constrative Estimation(NCE) and Importance Sampling(IS). 

Simply speacking, the difference between them is that IS they define considers a multiclass classification problem with a softmax and cross-entropy loss and NCE considers a binary classification task between true or noise words with a logistic loss. 

For IS(i.e. useful for training but maintain awful at inference time for still computing the normalization term over all words), in particular, they always used \\(w_1 \in W\\) as the word from true data.
