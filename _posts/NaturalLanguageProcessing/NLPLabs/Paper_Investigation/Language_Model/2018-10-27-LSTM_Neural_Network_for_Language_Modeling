This page is for my studying of NLP, 

Language model means If you have text which is "A B C X" and already know "A B C", and then from corpus, you can expect whether What kind of word, X appears in the context.

i.e. The task to predict a word(X) with the context("A B C") is the goal of Language model(LM).
