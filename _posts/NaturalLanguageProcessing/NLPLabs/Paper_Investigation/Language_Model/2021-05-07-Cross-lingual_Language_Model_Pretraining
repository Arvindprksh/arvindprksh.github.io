This is a brief summary of paper for me to study and organize it, [Cross-lingual Language model Pretraining (Conneau and Lample NIPS 2019)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/c04c19c2c2474dbf5f7ac4372c5b9af1-Paper.pdf) that I read and studied.

Recent studies have demonstrated the efﬁciency of generative pretraining for English natural language understanding. In this work, they extend this approach to multiple languages and show the effectiveness of cross-lingual pretraining. They propose two methods to learn cross-lingual language models (XLMs): one unsupervised that only relies on monolingual data, and one supervised that leverages parallel data with a new cross-lingual language modelo bjective. They obtain state-ofthe-art resultson cross-lingual classiﬁcation, unsupervisedand supervised machine translation. On XNLI, their approach pushes the state of the art by an absolute gain of 4.9% accuracy. On unsupervised machine translation, they obtain 34.3 BLEU on WMT’16 German-English, improving the previous state of the art by more than 9 BLEU. On supervised machine translation, they obtain a new state of the art of 38.5 BLEU on WMT’16 Romanian-English, outperforming the previous best approach by more than 4 BLEU.
