This is a brief summary of paper for me to study and organize it, [Neural Architectures for Named Entity Recognition (Lample et al., NAACL 2016)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1030/) I read and studied. 
{% include MathJax.html %}

They propose two method for Named Entity recognition (NER) task. 

The one is bidirectinal LSTM with conditional random field.

The other is stack LSTMs for chuncking method, inspired by transition-based parsing

In their methods, they used character embeddding to use e orthographic or morphological information.

>>They found that the Stack-LSTM model is more dependent on character-based representations to achieve competitive performance. they hypothesize that the LSTM-CRF model requires less orthographic information since it gets more contextual information out of the bidirectional LSTMs. However, the Stack-LSTM model consumes the words one by one and it just relies on the word representations when it chunks words.  



<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note(Abstract): </b>
State-of-the-art named entity recognition systems rely heavily on hand-crafted features and domain-specific knowledge in order to learn effectively from the small, supervised training corpora that are available. In this paper, they introduce two new neural architecturesâ€”one based on bidirectional LSTMs and conditional random fields, and the other that constructs and labels segments using a transition-based approach inspired by shift-reduce parsers. Their models rely on two sources of information about words: character-based word representations learned from the supervised corpus and unsupervised word representations learned from unannotated corpora. Their models obtain state-of-the-art performance in NER in four languages without resorting to any language-specific knowledge or resources such as gazetteers.
