This is a brief summary of paper for me to study and arrange for [Named Entity Recognition with Bidirectional LSTM-CNNs. Chiu and Nichols. 2016 TACL](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/Q16-1026/) I read and studied.

This paper is a research ralted to NER tagging. 

They designed the model with Bi-LSTM-CNN. The CNN extracted the information of characters consisting of the word. 

Their model is as follows:

The whole model is

To extract a feature vector from the per-character vector

They used the BIOES annotation to label the word into the corresponding catergorical tag, methioning this scheme has reported to outperform others such as BIO([Ratino and Roth, 2009 CoNLL](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W09-1119/))

>> BIOES annotation (Begin, Inside, Outside, End, Single), indicating the position of the token in the matched entry. In other words, B will not appear in a suffix-only partial match, and E will not appear in a prefix-only partial match.

based on their experiement, they said that the plain SGD is bettern than other optimization algorithms.

Named entity recognition is a challenging task that has traditionally required large amountsof knowledge in the form of feature engineering and lexicons to achieve high performance. In this paper, they present a novel neural network architecture that automatically detects word- and character-level features using a hybrid bidirectional LSTM and CNN architecture, eliminating the need for most feature engineering. They also propose a novel method of encoding partial lexicon matches in neural networks and compare it to existing approaches. Extensive evaluation shows that, given only tokenized text and publicly available word embeddings
