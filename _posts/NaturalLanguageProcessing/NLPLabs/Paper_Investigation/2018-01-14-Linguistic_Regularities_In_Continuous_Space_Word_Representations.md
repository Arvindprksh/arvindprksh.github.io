The paper, "Linguisitic Regularities in Continuous Space Word Representation" explains how to evaluate sytantic and semantic regularities between the induced word vectors, with a form as "king - Man + Woman" result in a vector veryl clost to "Queen".

i.e. When you evaluate syntatic and semantic regularities with word vector representations in continous space. you have to create a test set of analogy questions of the form "a is to b as c is to \_\_\_".
