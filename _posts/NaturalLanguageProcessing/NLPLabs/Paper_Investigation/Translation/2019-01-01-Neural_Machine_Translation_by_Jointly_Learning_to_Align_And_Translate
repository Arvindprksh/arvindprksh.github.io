This is a brief summary of paper, [Neural Machine Translation By jointly Learning to align and translate, Bahdanau et al.(ICLR 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) I read and study. 

The goal that I am writing this post to is for me to study what is the Attention on deep learning.

{% include MathJax.html %}

One of laguage understanding task is translation between a pair of sentence.
