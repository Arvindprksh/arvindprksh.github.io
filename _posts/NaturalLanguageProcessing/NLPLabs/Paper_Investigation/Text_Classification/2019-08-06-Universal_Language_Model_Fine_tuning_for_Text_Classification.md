This is a brief summary of paper for me to study and organize it, [Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification (Howard and Ruder., ACL 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) I read and studied.

They propose how to fine-tune Language model to transfer into another task. 

The fine-tuning of LM has a problem called **catastrophic forgetting**

So They argue, when you fine-tune LM, you apply correct way to do fine-tunning.

They propose two types of fine-tuning, **discriminative fine-tuning** and **slanted triangular learning rates**.

- Discriminative fine-tuning 

> As different layers acpture different types of information(Yosinki et al., 2014), they shoud be fine-tuned to different extents using different learning rates.

- slanted triangular le fine-tuning 

> This is the way to adapt model's parameters to task-specific features to quickly converge to a suitable region of the parameter space in the beginning of training and the refine its parameter.

Also they proposed fine-tuning of classifier. 

The way to fine-tune the classifier is  **gradual unfreezing** which is unfreezing the the model starting from last layer as this contains the least gneenral knowledge. i.e. They first unfreeze the last layer and fine-tune all unfrozen layers for one epoch. They then unfreeze the next lower layer and repeat, until they fine-tune all layers until convergence at the last iteration.

Inductive transfer learning has greatly impacted computer vision, but existing approaches in NLP still require task-specific modifications and training from scratch. We propose Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), an effective transfer learning method that can be applied to any task in NLP, and introduce techniques that are key for fine-tuning a language model. Our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on six text classification tasks, reducing the error by 18-24% on the majority of datasets. Furthermore, with only 100 labeled examples, it matches the performance of training from scratch on 100x more data. We open-source our pretrained models and code.
