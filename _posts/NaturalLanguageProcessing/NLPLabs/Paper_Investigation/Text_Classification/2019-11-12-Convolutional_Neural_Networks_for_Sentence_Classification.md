This is a brief summary of paper for me to study and organize it, [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification (Kim., EMNLP 2014)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1181/) I read and studied. 
{% include MathJax.html %}

They propose CNN architecture on top two sets of pre-training **word2vecs**, static and dynamic one.  

Their architecture is the followings:

For two sets of pre-training word vectors, one of **word2vecs** is kept static throughout training training and another is fine-tuned via backpropagation. 

The following is examples of top 4 neighboring words based on cosine similarity for static channel(left) and fine-tuned vectors in the non-static channel (right) for multichannel model.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note(Abstract): </b>
They report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks. They show that a simple CNN with little hyperparameter tuning and static vectors achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks. Learning task-specific vectors through fine-tuning offers further gains in performance. They additionally propose a simple modification to the architecture to allow for the use of both task-specific and static vectors.
