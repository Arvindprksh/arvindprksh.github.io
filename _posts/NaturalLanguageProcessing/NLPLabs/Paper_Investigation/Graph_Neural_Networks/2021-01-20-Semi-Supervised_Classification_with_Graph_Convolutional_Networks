This is a brief summary of paper for me to study and organize it, [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks (Kipf and Welling, ICLR 2017)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJU4ayYgl) that I read and studied. 
{% include MathJax.html %}

This method is Fast Approximation Spectral-based Graph Convolutional Networks.

###For training, they used the same neural network structure such as [Sutskever et al., NIPS 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) which uses a deep LSTM ot encode the input sequence and a separate deep LSTM to output the translation.

###For detailed experiment analysis, you can found in [Addressing the Rare Word Problem in Neural Machine Translation (Luong et al., ACL and IJCNLP 2015)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P15-1002/)
