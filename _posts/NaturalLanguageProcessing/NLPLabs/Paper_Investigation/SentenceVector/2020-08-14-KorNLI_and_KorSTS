This is a brief summary of paper for me to study and arrange it, [KorNLI and KorSTS: New Benchmark Datasets for Korean Natural Language Understanding (Ham et al., arXiv 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03289) I read and studied.

They proposes dataset for natural lanuage inference(NLI) and semantic textual similarity(STS) in Korean.

For NLI in Korean,

For STS In Korean,

As shown in figures above, they released the dataset for NLI and STS in Korean on [git repository](https://github.com/kakaobrain/KorNLUDatasets)


<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note(Abstract): </b>
Natural language inference (NLI) and semantic textual similarity (STS) are key tasks in natural language understanding (NLU). Although several benchmark datasets for those tasks have been released in English and a few other languages, there are no publicly available NLI or STS datasets in the Korean language. Motivated by this, they construct and release new datasets for Korean NLI and STS, dubbed KorNLI and KorSTS, respectively. Following previous approaches, they machine-translate existing English training sets and manually translate development and test sets into Korean. To accelerate research on Korean NLU, they also establish baselines on KorNLI and KorSTS. Their datasets are made publicly available via our GitHub repository.
