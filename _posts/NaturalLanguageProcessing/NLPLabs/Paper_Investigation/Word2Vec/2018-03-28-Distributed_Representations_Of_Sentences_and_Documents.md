I think sentence embeddings, document embeddings, and pragraph embedding have been studied in NLP, Because word embedding have beend tired in NLP field. 

Nowadays, it is important to embed sentences, documents, or paragraph on sentiment analysis and text classification. 

So I read a paper about how to embed setences and documents. 

The title of the paper is **Distributed Representations of Sentences and Documentes**.
