When you work with vim, you find out some character like **^M**.  

That is because Unix uses 0xA for a newline character. Windows uses a combination of two characters: 0xD 0xA. 

0xD is the carriage return character. ^M haapens to be the way vim displays 0xD(0x0D=13, M is the 13th letter in the English alphabet).

If you want to remove the character(^M) in vim. run the following in command mode:

> %s/^M//g

Where **^M** is entered by holding down **Ctrl** and typing **v** followed by **m**, i.e. pressing **Ctrl** and simultaneously pressing "v" and then "m".

after that, release **Ctrl**. 

This expression will replace all occurences of **^M** with the empty string(i.e. nothing). 

Normally It is used to get rid of **^M** in files copied from Windows to Unix such as Solaris, Linux, OSX)
