# QCT's Remote Control

  The following image show Remote Control Menu of QCT 
  
  ![](/img/Image/SSD-Solid_State_Drives/2016-10-12-QCT/QCT Remote Control.png)

  The remote console application, Which is started using the WebGUI, allows you to control your sever's operating system remotely,
  
  using the screen, mouse and keyboard, and to redirect local CD/DVD, Floppy diskette and hard disk/USB thumb drives as if they were connected directly to the server.
  
  I think probably KVM technology is used to control remotely.
  
  **always, I recommend you to read user guide to understand the basic principle**
  
  
## keyword

 using the **F2** and **DEL** key make you access into BIOS Setup utility. 
 
 **F11** is button to select boot device. 
 
<!--
At first, when you install OS, select AMI virtual CDROMO 000

next time, you have to configure boot device.

## Boot Option Screen

  ![](/img/Image/SSD-Solid_State_Drives/2016-10-12-QCT/Boot Option screen.png)
  
```
    Boot mode select | [LEGACY] | Select boot mode LEGACY/UEFI  |   This item decides what device(Legacy or UEFI) BIOS should    
                     | [UEFI]   |                               |   try to boot when let the system auto boot up without manually select boot device.
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I think you need to check up boot option screen 
  
  Boot mode select 
  
  if that is UEFI, I recommend you to change to LEGACY mode
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In other words, If you want to fix BIO and so on, just enter **F2** and **DEL**. 
  
  but Just you want to boot, enter **F11** and then choose. boot device
  

## BMC (Baseboard Management Controller)

  this is Sever Management Software.
  
  In a server System. BMC is an independent system of the host server system. This independent system has its own processor and memory: the host system can be managed by the BMC system even if the host hardware or OS hangs is unable to function.
  
  **Serail OVer LAN**
  
  BMC supports 1IPMI(Spec v2.0) specific SOL seesion. BMC supports redirect data from UART interface.
  
  In other words. BMC is managed by **IPMI protocol**
  
  later on, **what is the relationship among Nor memory and firmware and BIOS?**
  
  And **What is the EFI(Extensible firmware interface)?**
  
  Maybe component based on intel, what about [this site about EFI](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/efi-shells-and-scripting)

## Finally, [how to install CentOS 7](http://landoflinux.com/linux_install_centos_7.html)

  Another way :
