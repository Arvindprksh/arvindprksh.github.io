this article refers to [this open source(NVMe Cli)](https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli),nvme-cli, related to Nvme.

this is made of what I studied with open source, nvme-cli.

I am analyzingin the most basic command, read, write, dataset command.

and, in addition, If you see [the specification(NVM_Express_1_2)](http://nvmexpress.org/wp-content/uploads/NVM_Express_1_2_Gold_20141209.pdf) of nvme, It would be much better. 

# Analyse Open Source (nvme-cli-0.7-release version)

## Read

  this command is nvme read /dev/nvme0n1(nvme device) -s -c -z -d ...
   
   - function flow 
   
```c
  static int read_cmd(int argc, char ** argv)  
  {
      ...
    return submit_io(nvme_cmd_read, "read", desc, argc, argv);  
  }
     
  static int submit_io(int opcode, char *command, const char *desc, int argc, char **argv)  
  {  
       struct  timeval start_time, end_time;  
       void * buffer, * mbuffer = NULL;  
       int dfd, mfd;  
       int flags = opcode & 1 ? O_RDONLY : O_WRONLY | O_CREAT;  
       int mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR |S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP| S_IROTH;  
       __u16 control = 0;
       // mainly about variable I see carefully
       cfg.start-block (__u64), cfg.blockcount (__u16), cfg.data_size(__U64), cfg.data (char *)  
     
       parse_and_open(argc, argv, desc, command_line_options, &cfg, sizeof(cfg));  
     
       dfd = mfd = opcode & 1 ? STDIN_FILENO : STDOUT_FILENO; // file descriptor configuration    
        
       // function call    
       err = nvme_io(fd, opcode, cfg.start_block, cfg.block_count, control, 0,   
        cfg.ref_tag, cfg.app_tag, cfg.app_tag_mask, buffer, mbuffer);    
        ...
  }     
      
  int nvme_io(int fd, __u8 opcode, __u64 slba, __u16 nblocks, __u16 control,      
      __u32 dsmgmt, __u32 reftag, __u16 apptag, __u16 appmask, void *data,

            .rsvd           = 0, // defalt value     
            .metadata       = (__u64)(uintptr_t) metadata, // filename of sumbit_io function      
            .addr           = (__u64)(uintptr_t) data,   // filename of sumbit_io function    
            .slba           = slba,  // start_block of submit_io function     
            .dsmgmt         = dsmgmt,  //  0 of submit_io function     
            .reftag         = reftag,  //  ref_tag of submit_io function     
            .appmask        = apptag,  // app_tag of submit_io function    
            .apptag         = appmask, // app_tabg_mask of submit_io function      
          };    
        
      return ioctl(fd, NVME_IOCTL_SUBMIT_IO, &io);    
  }

# Theory about linux and C 

## C languge 

### #endef
 
  this opensource is using "#define" and ["#undef"](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ts4w8783.aspx)
 
  - Syntax

```c
    #undef
     identifier
```

   > briefly, The **#undef** directiv removes ther current of _identifier_. Consequently, subsequent occurences of _identifier_ are ignored by the preprocessor. To remove a macro definition using **#undef**, giv only the macro _identifier_ ; **_do not give a pararmeter list_**. 
   >
   > You can also apply the **#undef** directive to an identifier that has no previous definition. This ensures that identifier is undefined. Macro replacement is not performed within **#undef** statements.
   >
   > The #undef directive is typically paired with a **#undef** directive to create a region in a source program in which an identifier has a special meaning. For example, a specific function of the source program can use manifest constants to define evironment-specific values that do not affect the rest of the program. The **#undef** directive also works with the **#if** directive to control conditional compliation of the source program.
   >
   > In the following example, the **#undef** directive removes definitions of a symbolic constant and a macro. Note that only the identifier of the macro is given.
   
```c
    #define WIDTH 80
    #define ADD( X, Y) ((x) + (y))
    .
    .
    .
    #undef WIDTH
    #undef ADD
```
   
   
### Initialization of struct of C language in kernel

 this article below is made referring to [this site](https://linuxprograms.wordpress.com/2008/03/07/c-structure-initialization-advanced/) 
 
 basically, way to initialize variable of structure, the following shows you initialization of struct in Kernel
 
```c
  struct student {

     int roll;

     int class;

     char name[50];

};
```
 
 Now, let's declare a variable st3 and intialize using the third method.
 
 first, here is :
 
```c
 student st3={

           .name = "Mark", //Notice the equal to and the comma

           .class  = 10,

           .roll  = 1038

};
```
 
### Basename 
 
 this article is made by refering to [this site(basename)](http://linux.101hacks.com/unix/basename/) 
 
 - What is basename 
 
   > when you provide a string that contains a filename with full path, **basename** will remove only the directory portion of it, and return only the file name portion of that string, It can also remove that file extension, and return only the filename without an extension. 

 - Briefly, Example
 
   > $ basename /etc/passwd
   > passwd

   If file has extension :
   
   > $ basename /usr/local/apache2/conf/http.conf
   > httpd.conf
   
   If you get only filename without extension 
   
   > $ basename /usr/local/apach2/conf/httpd.conf .conf
   > httpd
   
 - Syntax and Options
   
   basename NAME [SUFFIX]
   basename OPTION


### fstat function 

   fstat(int fd, struct stat *buf) is used to get the status of file. the status is useful informations.

```c
struct stat { 
               dev_t     st_dev;     /* ID of device containing file */ 
               ino_t     st_ino;     /* inode number */ 
               mode_t    st_mode;    /* protection */ 
               nlink_t   st_nlink;   /* number of hard links */ 
               uid_t     st_uid;     /* user ID of owner */ 
               gid_t     st_gid;     /* group ID of owner */ 
               dev_t     st_rdev;    /* device ID (if special file) */ 
               off_t     st_size;    /* total size, in bytes */ 
               blksize_t st_blksize; /* blocksize for file system I/O */ 
               blkcnt_t  st_blocks;  /* number of 512B blocks allocated */ 
               time_t    st_atime;   /* time of last access */ 
               time_t    st_mtime;   /* time of last modification */ 
               time_t    st_ctime;   /* time of last status change */ 
           };
```

### Information, [aligned memory](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12881179/why-is-memory-alignment-required)

   >memory is aligned is senstive. If you want to know more about this information, just let's visit [this site(stackoverflow)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3655926/why-does-cpu-access-memory-on-a-word-boundary) and then 
   >If you can not understand the aligned memory, let's vistie [this site(unaligned-memory-access)](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/unaligned-memory-access.txt) one more time

  If you see specification of nvme, on page invovle with PRP, You can get hint that alignment is important.
  
   > The controller may support several physical formats of logical block size and associated metadata size.
   > There may be performance difference between different physical formats. This is indicated as part of the Identify Namespace datat structure. 
   

### the linux command

  during operating and fixing open source, nvme-cli, I noticed many thing about linux commands. 
  
  So here is arrangment of linux command I realized.
  
   - dd
   
    > dd command stands for "data duplicator" and used for copying and converting data. It is very powerful low level utility of Linux which can do much more.
    >
    > If you want to know more about dd command, I recommend [this site(linuxnix)](http://www.linuxnix.com/what-you-should-know-about-linux-dd-command/) and [another site(linoxide)](http://linoxide.com/linux-command/linux-dd-command-create-1gb-file/)  and [another site of stack overflow](http://superuser.com/questions/797664/whats-the-difference-between-dds-command-options-bs-1024-count-1-and-bs-1-coun)

   - echo $?
   
   > this command is you can check command works well, 

   - diff vs vimdiff
   
   > **diff** 
   > means in the command line, you can indentify difference with files. 
   >
   > Basically, you want to use this command, I recommend you [this site(livefirelabs)](http://www.livefirelabs.com/unix_commands/5-unix-diff-command-examples-of-how-to-compare-two-text-files.htm)
   > But, for hex dump file, recommend you [this site(stackoverflow)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16380090/diff-find-specific-change-between-two-values-in-hex-dump)
   >

   > **vimdiff**
   >
   > you can use vim and diff together. 
   >
   > you want to use this command, I recommend you [this site(vimdiff)](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/comparing-buffers-with-vimdiff/) and [another site(github)](https://gist.github.com/azadkuh/5d223d46a8c269dadfe4#vimdiff)
   
   
   - grep 
   
   > this command is what I like. when I'm searching for word. The following is basic sample.
 
```c
 $ grep -nir ab *
Binary file argconfig.o matches
completions/README:3:Setting Up NVMe Tab Autocompletion for bash or zsh
completions/README:20:you should be able to autocomplete with the nvme utility now
```

   - xxd filename

### I/O redirection in linux command line 

   I refer to [this site(linuxcommand)](http://linuxcommand.org/lts0060.php) for making a note of the following article.
   
   I would like to recommend one more thing, just I want you to visit [this site(digitalocean)](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-linux-i-o-redirection)
   
   you can be comportable , by using some specail notation you can redirect the outpur of many commands to file, devices, and even to the input of other commands in linux. 
   
   - Standard output
   
   > This standard output directs its contents to the display. To redirect standard output to a file, the ">" character is used > like this :
   >   ls > file_list.txt
   >
   > In this example, the **ls** command is executed and the results are written in a file named _file_list.txt_. since the output of **ls** was redirected, _file_list.txt_ is overwritten from the beginning with the output of the command **ls**.
   > If you want the new results to be appended to the file instead,  use ">>"

   - Standard input
   
   > This standard input gets its contents from the key usually, but It can be redirected. To redirect standar input from a file instead of the keyboard. the "<" character is used.
   > like this :
   >      sort < file_list.txt
   > 
   > In the above example, We used the sort command to process the contents of _file_list.txt_. The results are output on the display Since The standard output is not redirected in this example. We could redirect standard output to another file
   > like this :
   >        sort < file_list.txt > sorted_file_list.txt
   >
   > As you can see, the above command can have both its input and output redirected. Be aware that the order of the redirection does not matter. The only requirement is that the redirection operators ( the "<" and ">") must appear after the other options and arguments in the command.

    
   - Pipes
   
   > By far, The most useful and powerful thing you can do with I/O redirection is to connect mutilple commands together with what are called pipes. with pipes, the standard output of one command is fed into the standard input of another. here is my absolute favorite :
   >
   > ls -l | less
   >
   > In this example, the output of the **ls** command is fed into **less**. by using this "| less" trick, you can make any command have scrolling output. I use this technique all the time

### special file of linux

   - /dev/random or /dev/urandom
   
   > This is the linux kernel's built-in Random Number gernerator /dev/{u}random are accalimed for producing reliable random data providing the same security level that is used for the creation of cryptographic keys.

   - /dev/zero & /dev/null
    
   > /dev/zero
   > > this is used to create dummy file.
   > > /dev/zero produces a continuous stream of NULL(zero value) bytes.
   >

### test file 

     printf 'HelloWorld\n%.0s' {1..5} is useful when I generate file With I/O indirection 

<!--
#dd if=/dev/urandom of=./write_wu bs=4096 count=64
#dd if=/dev/urandom of=./write_page bs=4096 count=8
#dd if=/dev/urandom of=./write_slice bs=4096 count=1
	for i in {0..7}
	do
		cat ./xu_write_for_test/write_page >> ./xu_write_for_test/write_wu_page
		echo "susda $i"
	done
	
	or diff
	
local temp=
	temp=$(diff ./xu_write_for_test/xu_write ./xu_write_for_test/xu_write-copy)

	test sfjs sfljs sdfjl k
	
	if [ "$temp" != "" ]; then
		echo "diff same $temp"
		echo ""
	fi
	temp=$(diff ./xu_write_for_test/xu_write ./xu_write_for_test/xu_write2)
	
	echo "diff different $temp"
	echo ""
