# After knowing the above tool, I tried to install qemu to work on Lightnvm

 I think that [lightnvm.io](http://lightnvm.io/) is official site. In this site. You can get hint about lightnvm. 
 
 From now on, It is important to konw preparation for lihgtnvm. 
 
 First of all, How to install lightnvm is important. **BUT** If you have a specitif device for test lihgtnvm. 
 
 when you test lightnvm, It is difficult.
 
 So, We will have to utilize the QEMU, virtualiztion. 
 
 for brief informaion, There is [User Documentation's geting started](http://openchannelssd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/) of [lihgtnvm.io](http://lightnvm.io/)

 AS you can see the contents of [lightnvm.io] and [User Documentation's geting started](http://openchannelssd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/).
 
 In order to start testing lihgtnvm. you need to install [the QEMU](http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page) for vitualization. 
 
 So From now on I will implement procedure of installation of The QEMU on Centos 7.
