# RAM disk 
 
  - RAM Disk is a portion which is used like physical storage.
  - any data stored on RAM disk is lost when system is shut down or powered off, So RAM disk is great place to put the temporary data.  
  - Generally, RAM based file system is two types. one is rampfs, the other is tmpfs. 

  command to make RAMdisk on CentOS 7 
  
  > $ mount -t tmpfs -o size=2G tmpfs /directory position

 for example
 
```bash
$ mkdir ramdisk
$ mount -t tmpfs -o size=2G tmpfs ./ramdisk
```

# What is the differenc between ramdfs and tmpfs

  Primarily both ramfs and tmpfs does the same thing with few minor difference. 
  
  - RAMFS will grow dynamically : So you need control the process that wirtes the date to make sure ramfs doesn't go above the abailable RAM size in the system. 
  
  - Tmpfs will not grow up dynamically : It would not allow you to write more that the size you've specified while mounting the tmpfs. 
  
  - Tmpfs uses Swap
  
  - but RAMFS doesn't use swap
  
#  procedure after getting a new device 

 1. this is juse option, you have to get partition from a storage device. 
 
 fdisk or anther command 
 
 2. you have to make file system format. 
 
 mkfs
 
 3. and then you have to mount device some directory. 

 mount 
 
# Appendix 

  Just I found out mkramdisk command on [IBM AIX](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_aix_72/com.ibm.aix.cmds3/mkramdisk.htm)
  
  But I cannot find that command in CentOs 7
  
  ```console
   $ mkramdisk 
bash: mkramdisk: command not found...
  ```

# How to use ramdisk as another disk to mkfs 

a hint is loop device, but I don't know currently(2016-10-25) about loop device maybe when I need this loop device. 

I have to search for loop device. 

sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=8G tmpfs ramdisk/

cd ramdisk/

sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=disk.img bs=4k count=2048000

sudo losetup /dev/loop0 disk.img

cd ..

sudo ./mkfs.f2fs /dev/loop0

sudo mount /dev/loop0 ramdisk-target/
