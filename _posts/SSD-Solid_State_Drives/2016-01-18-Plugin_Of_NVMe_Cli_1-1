## [NVMe-cli-1.1's plugin mode](https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli#add-a-new-plugin)

From NVMe-cli-1.1, new operation is added for Developers who want to add a new command or possibily an entirely new plug-in for some special extension outside the spec.

For your more information, URL : [Developers of nvme-cli](https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli#developers)

**BUT**, You can add VU command outside the spec into nvme-cli-1.1 using nvme-builtin.h 

If you want to know how to make VU command using nvme-builtin.h. Please refer to [my another blog](./2017/01/13/NVMe_Cil/)

**BUT**, at this time, I will use the another way, that is adding a new plugin.
