## [nvme list](https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli/blob/master/Documentation/nvme-list.txt)

  I think this command is not default on LINUX, BUT If YOU install nvme-cli(open source tool), You can use it. 
 
```shell
  $ nvme list 
```

  and then you can check the list of nvme. 
  
  For example
  
``` 
  Node      SN      Model       Version     Nmaesapce       Usage     Format      FW Rev. 
  -----    -----    ------      -------     -----------     --------  ---------   ---------
```

  -- I think this is so simple, but If you change the open source, you can get much information. 
  
## [nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0n1](https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli#alpinelinux)

  When I have to calculate WAF, of course, You can use [teraterm](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en), that is you need window and usb cable. 
  
  But just if you have linux machine, it easy to use nvme-cli tool with the following command. 
  
```shell
  $ nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0n1  
```

  in my test on Centos 7
 
```
# in my nvme-cli folder

$ sudo ./nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0n1
Smart Log for NVME device:nvme0n1 namespace-id:00000000
critical_warning                    : 0
temperature                         : 0 C
available_spare                     : 0%
available_spare_threshold           : 0%
percentage_used                     : 0%
data_units_read                     : 0
data_units_written                  : 0
host_read_commands                  : 0
host_write_commands                 : 0
controller_busy_time                : 0
power_cycles                        : 0
power_on_hours                      : 00
unsafe_shutdowns                    : 0
media_errors                        : 0
num_err_log_entries                 : 0
Warning Temperature Time            : 0
Critical Composite Temperature Time : 0
Temperature Sensor 1                : 0 C
Temperature Sensor 2                : 0 C
Temperature Sensor 3                : 0 C
Temperature Sensor 4                : 0 C
Temperature Sensor 5                : 0 C
Temperature Sensor 6                : 0 C
```

  as I can say, it is easy to get the result rather than tera term
  
  in tera term 
  
```
  smartdbg 0(option number)
```
  
  this is too much cost
  
 ### More extensible case with grep on smart-log
 
  In other words, see [his site](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/37313/how-do-i-grep-for-multiple-patterns)
 
 ```shell 
 $ sudo ./nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0n1 | grep 'data_units_written\|host_write_commands'
data_units_written                  : 0
host_write_commands                 : 0 
 ```
