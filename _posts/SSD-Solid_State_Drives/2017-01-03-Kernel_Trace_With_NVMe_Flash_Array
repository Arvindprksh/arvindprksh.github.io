SSD itself is fast IOPs. 

But depending on application, server architecte, and administrator tools that data center use, manager and developer doesn't make a consideration of performance that consists of all flash array with NVMe.

let's see what kind of feature can affect IOPs and speed of SSD in kernel.

## Scheduler of Kernel

 objective of kernel's Scheduler is fair. So each process has priority. 
 
 Let's see How to configure what type of features in linux.
