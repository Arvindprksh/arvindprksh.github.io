When you use remote server. you have a inconvenience. So I recommend you this VNC for more environment of development

# [What is the VNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing)

  by information of [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing), 
  
  To sum up, VNC(virtual Network Computing) is a graphical desktop system that uses the Remote Frame buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from one computer to another, relaying the graphical screen updates back in the other direction. over a network.
  
  Another [reference](http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-network-computing). 
  
  As you can see on the another reference, 
  
  VNC works on a client/server model : A VNC viewer (or client) is istalled on the local computer and connects to the server component, which must be installed on the remote computer. 
  
  regarding working of VNC server, 
  
  The sever transmits a duplicate of the remote computer's display screen to the viewer. It also interprets commands coming from the viewer and carries them out on the remote computer. 
  
  feature of VNC is platfrom-independent and is compatible with any operating system. Computers must be networked with TCP/IP and have open ports allowing traffic from the IP addresses of devices that may need to connect
  
  after reaing [Techtarget site](http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-network-computing). 
  
  I realized my procedure of installing VNC. 
  
  First, I have to install viewer on client I will use. 
  
  Second, on server I will use, in order to connect to view. I have to install server of VNC. 
  
   
---

  For installation of VNC, I will try on two cases. 
  
  **First is Windows 7(Client) & Linux - CentOS 7(Server)**
  
  **Second is CentOS 7(Client) & CentOS 7(Server)**
  
  First of all, in case I will utilize for installation of VNC.
  
  The same thing is just that server is CentOS 7(server). 
  
  So I will explain to you how to set up Serever with three sites.
  
  In other words, About setting of VNC server
---
  
# Server setting of VNC 

## First of all, RedHat

  First Site is [Redhat.](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/ch-TigerVNC.html)
  
  On Chapter 10. TIGERVNC, As you can read contents of redhat's Installing VNC Server.
  
  The most important thing is TigerVNC works on the Client-server principle :
  
  > Server shares its output(VNCserver) and Client(VNCviewer) connects to server.
  
  
  Characteristic of VNCServer is users run separate sessions in parallel on a machine which can then be accessed by any number of clients from anywhere. i.e VNC is platform-independent.
  
  I emphasize one thing, from now on, my explanation bases that OS of server is CentOS 7
  
### step 1. Install TigerVNC server with issuing the following command as root :

  > **# yum install -y tigervnc-server**
  
### step 2. Configure VNC Server

 You need to creat configuration file. 
 
 So issue the following command as root :
 
 > **# cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/vncserver@.service /etc/systemd/system/vncserver.service**

 a carfule point :
 
 > There is no need to include the display number in the file name because systemd automatically creates the appropriately named instance in memory on demand, replacing '%i' in the service file by the display number.
  
  
 And then, you have edit /etc/systemd/system/vncserver@.serivce, replacing USER with the actual user name, 
 
 In my case of installation, **USER=hyunyoung.lee**
  
 Leave the remaining lines of the file unmodified.!
 
 > The Original   
 > ExecStart=/usr/sbin/runuser -l USER -c "/usr/bin/vncserver     
 > %i -geometry 1280x1024"     
 > PIDFile=/home/USER/.vnc/%H%i.pid     
  
 > My case     
 > ExecStart=/usr/sbin/runuser -l Hyunyoung.ee -c "/usr/bin/vncserver     
 > %i -geometry 1280x1024(or 1920x1080)"    
 > PIDFile=/home/Hyunyoung.lee/.vnc/%H%i.pid    
  
 > BUT, If you want to root   
 > ExecStart=/usr/sbin/runuser -l root -c "/usr/bin/vncserver    
 > %i -geometry 1280x1024(or 1920x1080)"     
 > PIDFile=/root/.vnc/%H%i.pid    
  
 And To make sure that your changes take effect.
 
 issue the following command 
 
 > **# systemctl daemon-reload**
 
 for password of user defined in the configuration file.
 
 **Note that, you need to switch from root to USER first**
  
  > **# su - USER in my case, su - hyunyoung.lee**  -> this means switching from su to USER    
  > $ vncpasswd    --> this means passwd of vnc when client accesses this machine with VNC Client.    
  > Password:   
  > Verify:   
  
## step 3. Start VNC Server

  To start or enable the service, specify the display number directly in the command.
  
  The file configured above in etc/systemd/system/vncserver@.service works as a template, in which %i is subsitituted with the display number by systemd. With a valid display number, execute the following command :
  
  > **# systemctl start vncserver@:display_number.service**  
  > In my case    
  > **# systemctl start vncserver@:1.service** (for Windows)   
  > **# systemctl start vncserver@:2.service** (for CentOS 7)  
  
  You can also enable the service to start automatically at system start(boot time). Then, When you log in, vncserver is automatically started. As root, issue a command as follows :
  
  >**# systemctl enable vncserver@:display_number.service**  
  > In my case   
  > **# systemctl enable vncserver@:1.service** (for Windows)    
  > **# systemctl enable vncserver@:2.service** (for CentOS 7)    
 
  At this point, I was wondering Where the display number is started from. 
  
  So, I found out one blog of [VNC Quick Start Instructions](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~info/vnc.txt)
  
  I cite the above site's article. 
  
  The contents of the above site is as follows :
  
  > The VNCserver runs on two ports: 5900 + :"display number" and 5800 + : "display number". Port 5900 + :<num> is for the standalone viewer. Port 5800 + :<num> for a java based, web browser viewer.
primarily we will be concerned with port 5900 + :<num>

  > The display number defines which virtual screen the vncserver runs on, and distinguishes among several concurrent VNC Sessions. The display number has the format ":n" where n a small integer number.   
  > On windows, by default the vnc server shows the console desktop and is :0 (so runs on port 5900/5800). Both Linux and Solaris follow the X window display number convetion. So they usually start on :1  or 5901  / 5801 for the firts session (becuase : 0 is  taken by the console x Server). when you run vncserver, it will automatically choose a port number that does not already have an Xserver running. Multiple vncservers can be started with different display numbers or the display number can be set on the command line. 
  
  To sum up, 
  
  For a java based web browser viewer. 5800 + " display number"
  
  BUT
  
  For Stanalone, 5900 + : "display number"
  
  Primarlily we will be concerned with port 5900 + <num>
  
  display nubmer starts from 1
  
  
  after you issue the command, systemctl 
  
  **Multi user case is different, So you have to another site text.**
  
  Now, You can access to this VNC sever to use a VNC viewer.  
    
## Step 4. terminate a VNC session
  
   similarly to eabling the VNCserver service, you can disable the automatic start of the service at system start(booting time)
   
   > **# systemctl disable vncserver@:display_number.service**  

  Or, When your system is running, you can stop the service by issuing the following commands as root :
  
   > **# systemctl stop vncserver@:display_number.service**   
   
# Before client get access to VNC-Server. at first, Sever have to stop Firewall
   
  In my Case, Server is CentOS. So I refered to [Firewall portion of Redhat's VNCViewer](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/sec-vnc-viewer.html#sec-installing-vncviewer)

  S0, I Can my action into two ways as follows. 
  
##  Firts of all, stop Firewall of each port to stop the firewall. 
  
### Configuring the firewall for VNC

   To open a specific port or a range of ports, make use of the **--add-port** option to the firewall-cmd command Line tool. 
   
   For example, VNC display 7 requires port 5907 to be opened for TCP traffic. 
   
   1. To open a port for TCP traffic in the public zone, issue a command as root as follows :
   
   > $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=5907/tcp     
   > success    
   
   **If you enter the above command,"firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=5907/tcp", After success, you get a message as follows**
   
```
   $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=5907/tcp
   [sudo] password for hyunyoung.lee: 
    Warning: ALREADY_ENABLED
```
  
    2. To view the ports that are currently open for the public zone, issue a command as follows :
    
    > $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports     
    
```
    5907/tcp
```
  
    3. A port can be removed using the firewall-cmd --zone=zone --remove-port=number/protocol command
    
    In my case, 
    
    > $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=5907/tcp      
    
    Note that this changes will not persist after the next system start. To make permanent changes to the firewall, 
    
    repeat the commands adding the  **--permanent option**. For more information on opening and closing ports in firewalld, 
    
    see [the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Security Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Security_Guide/).
    
    i.e, 
    
    > $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=5907/tcp      
    > $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports      
    > $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --remove-port=5907/tcp     
 
---

  Another way with FireWarll-cmd to stop FireWall
    
  **if you want to allow VNC service in FireWall.**
    
  > $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service vnc-server  
    
```
$ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service vnc-server
success
```
    
  **permanent version** 
    
  > $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service vnc-server    
    
<!-- sudo systemctl restart firewalld.service -->
 
  **for removal of NVC service.**
    
  > $ sudo firewall-cmd --remove-service vnc-server    
    
```
$ sudo firewall-cmd --remove-service vnc-server   
success
```
    
  **permanent version**
    
  > $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service vnc-server    
    
  
### To sum up about the above job to stop FireWall

  > $ firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=5907/tcp    
  > $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports     
  
  **for removal**
  
  > $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=5907/tcp     
  
  **If you want to have permanent changes **
  
  > $ firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=5907/tcp    
  > $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports     
  
  **for removal**
  
  > $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --remove-port=5907/tcp    
  
---
  
  **Unlike the above version,**
  
   > $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service vnc-server  
   
  **for removal**
  
   > $ sudo firewall-cmd --remove-service vnc-server  
   
   **In here, if you want to have permanent change**   
   
   > $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service vnc-server   
   
   **for removal**
   
   > $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service vnc-server    

---

  **Another way to stop firewall
  
  > $ sudo systemctl stop firewalld    
  > $ sudo systemctl status firewalld   
  
  IF you want to restart firewalld
  
  > $ sudo systemctl start firewalld   
  > $ sudo systemctl status firewalld   
  
---
  
  **The last method to turn off FireWall on CentOS 7**
  
  > $ sudo vim /etc/sysconfig/selinux       
  >         
  > In the file of /etc/sysconfig/selinux   
  >    
  >           SELINUX=disabled  
  > $ systemctl stop firewalld   
  > $ systemctl disable firewalld    
  > $ shutdown -r now

# Client setting of VNC

## Next stage to cennect to VNC server on [VNC-viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/)

  I will use [realVNC client tool](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/). but After installation of the above VNC-server. 
  
  I got access but, I got a message of error that is "Timed out waiting for a response from the host computer"
  
  I think that's because FireWall works, So I will try to remove the FireWall. 
  
  Before I turn off the Firewall, I cannot get access.
  
  as I expected, after turning the FireWall off Or opening a specific port. I can get access to VNCServer.
  
  From now on, I will access with two ways to VNCServer. 
  
### For Windows Client With [realVNC](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/)  
  
  my case is windows 7 client
  
  I think this way is the most simple. 
  
  Just first Install the [realVNC](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/).
  
  After download. you can get the below window. **maybe if you want to know security about realVNC, see [FAQ of realVNC](https://www.realvnc.com/docs/faq/safety.html#is-vnc-remote-access-safe)
  
 several of the following image refered to image of digitaloneocean's VNC installation](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-vnc-remote-access-for-the-gnome-desktop-on-centos-7)  
  
 1. execute VNC Viwer of RealVNC, In box of VNC Server, You have to ip address and port number of VNC server
 
 ![](/img/Image/SSD-Solid_State_Drives/2016-10-13-VNC/RealVNC VIEWER In WINDOWS 7 1.PNG)
 
 2. If you stop FireWall of VNCServer, you will get the below windows. 
 
 ![](/img/Image/SSD-Solid_State_Drives/2016-10-13-VNC/RealVNC VIEWER In WINDOWS 7 2.PNG)
  
 3. So, you are going to have to stop the FireWall of VNCserver, After that, You can get access to VNCServer. 
 
 So if it works well, you will get the below similar window. 
 
 ![](/img/Image/SSD-Solid_State_Drives/2016-10-13-VNC/RealVNC VIEWER In WINDOWS 7 3.png)
 
 4. After number 3. You have to use password that you configrued when issuing "vncpasswd" with password like this :

```shell
- In USER Mode On VNC-Server. You have to configure passwd for client to use when client accesses with VNC-Client.
$ vncpasswd
Password:
Verify:
```
  
 ![](/img/Image/SSD-Solid_State_Drives/2016-10-13-VNC/RealVNC VIEWER In WINDOWS 7 4.png)
 
 5. Finally, you cat get a access to VNC Server
 
 ![](/img/Image/SSD-Solid_State_Drives/2016-10-13-VNC/RealVNC VIEWER In WINDOWS 7 5.PNG)
  
### For Linux Client  
   
  my case is CentOS 7 client	
  
  the following explanation refered to VNC Viewer of Red Hat. 
  
  needless to say, it is easier to install and execute once the VNC sever is configured. 
  
  Most of all, You have to install VNC viewer. 
  
  On CentOS 7 
  
  > $ sudo yum install -y tigervnc
  
  From now on. I will you about running the vnc viewer on CentOS 7
  
  way to connect to VNC server is divided into three ways
  
  Each ways is Using GUI and Using CLI. 
   
#### Using GUI   

  > $ sudo yum install -y tigervnc
  
  The format of the command for GUI to connection of server-client  is as follows :
  
  > $ vncviewer
  
  After entering The above command, You can see the below window. 
  
  ![](/img/Image/SSD-Solid_State_Drives/2016-10-13-VNC/GUI connection of VNC0.png)
  
  in the box of VNC Server, You have to type your server address and display number
  
  ![](/img/Image/SSD-Solid_State_Drives/2016-10-13-VNC/GUI connection of VNC1.png)
  
  After that, press the button of connect, you can get window entering password that is the same configuring command as follows
  
```
- In USER Mode On VNC-Server. You have to configure passwd for client to use when client accesses with VNC-Client.
$ vncpasswd
Password:
Verify:
```
  
  ![](/img/Image/SSD-Solid_State_Drives/2016-10-13-VNC/GUI connection of VNC2.png)
  
  Finally, you can access VNC Server.
  
  **If you want to prevent disconnecting  any existing VNC connections to the same display, you can select option to allow sharing of the desktop as follows**
  
  A. Select the **Option** button
  
  ![](/img/Image/SSD-Solid_State_Drives/2016-10-13-VNC/Allow sharing of the desktop VNC Connection of GUI0.png)
  
  B. Selet the **Misc** tab.
  
  ![](/img/Image/SSD-Solid_State_Drives/2016-10-13-VNC/Allow sharing of the desktop VNC Connection of GUI1.png)
  
  C. selet the **Shared** button.
  
  ![](/img/Image/SSD-Solid_State_Drives/2016-10-13-VNC/Allow sharing of the desktop VNC Connection of GUI2.png)
  
  D. Press **OK** to return to the main menu. 
  
  **In my case, I didn't use this because user was one**

#### Using CLI  a prompt executiong of VNC Server-client connection

  > $ sudo yum install -y tigervnc

  1. Enter the viewer command with the address and display number as arguments :
  
  > $ vncviewer address:display_number
  
  Where address is an IP address or host name
  
  In this case, just it is different to enter host address and display number. 
  
  already when you execute vncviewer. You type host address and display number together. 
  
  So you don't have to type host addrss and display number. So just this process entering host address and display number is not abscent In using CLI
  
  and The left process is the same from using GUI

  ![](/img/Image/SSD-Solid_State_Drives/2016-10-13-VNC/Using CLl1.png)
  
   i.e after typing the above command,**"$ vncviewer address:display_number"**
   
   Just authenticate yourself by entering the VNC password. This will be the VNC password for the user corresponding to the display number unless a global default VNC password was set.
   
   And then, A window appears showing the VNC server desktop, Note that this is not the desktop the normal user sees, it is the Xvnc desktop. 
   
  **AND if you want to restrict VNC Access on Centos 7, I recommend you [VNC viewer of Red hat](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/sec-vnc-viewer.html#sec-installing-vncviewer)**

##### Using SSH

   On CentOs 7 of client

  The weak point of VNC is a clear text network protocol with no security against possible attacks on the communication. to make the communication secure, you can encrypt your server-client connection by using the "-via" option. This will create an SSH turnnel between the VNC Server and client.
  
  The format of the command to encrypt VNC server-clinet connection is as follows :
  
  > $ vncviewer -via USER@host:display_number
  
  For example :
   
  > $ vncviewer -via USER@host ::1 or $ vncviewer -via USER@host IP:port number
 
--> 
 
<!--  You have to configure SSH on Server side. after that, you can use the service of SSH. -->
 
<!-- 
  when I issue the above command, error happened as follows
  
  > ssh: Could not resolve hostname IP Address: Name or service not known
  
  But, In my case, on Server side, sshd.service works well

```
  $ systemctl status sshd
\u25cf sshd.service - OpenSSH server daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/sshd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Wed 2016-10-12 16:27:40 PDT; 6 days ago

   CGroup: /system.slice/sshd.service
           \u2514\u25001650 /usr/sbin/sshd -D
```

  So I install openssh-clients on client CentOS 7

  > $ sudo yum -y install openssh-clients
  
  and using ssh command, I could access the server desktop 
  
```
  $ ssh USER@IP address
  USER@IP address's password: 
  Last failed login: Tue Oct 18 20:04:05 PDT 2016
  There were 4 failed login attempts since the last successful login.
  Last login: Wed Oct 12 16:29:17 2016
  USER@IP address's password: exit
  logout
  Connection to IP address closed.
```
  
  BUT with VNC viewer, I cannot access  desktop of the VNC server
  
  If I want to access VNC Server with SSH for you information and my solution,
