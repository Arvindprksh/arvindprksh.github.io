When I touched server like datacenter. I experienced a various thing that I didn't know whan I was in univercity. 

So, before I forget the keyword and concept. I am going to summarize those things !

## EFI
  
  The EFI Sytem partion(ESP) is a partition on a data storage device (usually a hard disk drive or solid-state drive) that is used by computer adhering to the unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).
  
  when a computer is booted. UEFI firmware loads files stored on the EXP to start installed operating systems and various utilities.
  
  An ESP needs to be formatted with a files system.

## EFI shell

  Extensible firmware interface (EFI) brings new flexibility and opportunities to users by allowing them to work in the layer between their OS and BIOS, without altering either one.
  
  
  **I think some device has nor memory, So user can do programming on this nor memory to do something in firmware level.**
  
  at that time, user have to use the EFI shell. 
  
  This is what I understad when I dealt with server of SSD. 
  
  So, When I used server of SSD with the CentOS, sometimes I would boot into EFI shell mode or normal booting mode.
  
  **at that time. in order to fit this problem. I entered "booting menu", and then, I chaged booting device to where I want to boot.**
  
  In my case, when I configure priority of booting, firts is hard disk that I installed CentOS 7
  
## BMC (boardbased management controller)



## impi (Intelligent Platform Management Interface)


## command that I used to check up status of machine.
