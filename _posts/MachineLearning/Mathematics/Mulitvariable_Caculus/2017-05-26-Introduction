# Thinking about multivariable functions

##  Introduction  to multivariable calculus 

Here, I could check what multivariable functios are a little bit. 

Just, it is function but, that has two input variables. 

Normally, you will think about calculus as follows. 

f(x) = x ** 2

but, if function has two input varialbes, I can expresses like these. 

f(x, y) = x ** 2 + y

in the above case, I can say f(x, y) is just a point

also, anoother way to expresss two input variables is :

f([x, y]) = [2*x, 3*y], its result is equal to a vector. 

as you can see above, you can feel like **a vector** about result of function. 

get used to the expression and graph that the multivariable functions draw with Khah Academy's vedio


<div id="tutorial-section">

  <div id="tutorial-title">Tutorial</div>

  <ul class="nav nav-pills">
    <li class="active"><a data-toggle="tab" href="#short-tutorial">Short - 5 min</a></li>
    <li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#long-tutorial">Long - 30 min</a></li>
  </ul>

  <div class="tab-content">
    <div id="short-tutorial" class="tab-pane fade in active">

Let's play with python to express the above expression. 

```python
