by chance, I found Caffe Library. 

the way I foud the caffe Library is someone,has a problem wiht caffe, resolved the problem after seeing my gitpage.

So, she let me know the caffe library and information about machine learning a little. 

So from now on, I think it is interested, so I am going to study machine learning. 


If I foget this. Just simply, I make a note of that.

When I learned and heard About Machine Learning. the type of Machine learning is five type. 

when I was interested in Natural language. [SVM(support vector machine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_m achine) was popular on me.

Because of classification of data,especially text. 

But Nowadays, just neural network way is popular regardless of graphic and text. 

from now on, the following is just for me to remember. 


 - Caffe library 
 
    - this is based on BLAS, I think this can switch between CPU and GPU. 
    
Later on, I think knowing about Tensorflow with Keras will be needed.

that is attractive 

When I studied about natural languge. from SVM, I can learn many things like tf-idf, similarity of vector to compare between both datas.
