# [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
 
Given an array of integers, return indices of two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. 
 
you may assume that each input would have exactly one solution  

 - Example
 
  Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9, 
  
  Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 =9, 
  
  return [0, 1].

```c
/**
 * Note: The returned array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().
 */
int* twoSum(int* nums, int numsSize, int target) {
    
}
```

# My Solution. 

 1. brute force.
 
  - Just utilize two for statement 
  - So after that I have to check if each sum is the same value given.
  - after finding solution, just you have to checking order of index. 
   So if returnArr[0] is greater than  returnArr[1], you have to change value of each returnArr 
 
```c
int* twoSum(int* nums, int numsSize, int target) {

 int * returnArr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)*2);
 int i =0, j=0;
 
// memset(returnArr, 0 , sizeof(returnArr)); 
 
 for(i = 0 ; i < numsSize ; i++) {
   for(j = 0 ; j < numsSize ; j++) {
   
      if (i == j)
        continue; 
      
      if ( (nums[i] + nums[j]) == target){
          returnArr[0] = i;
          returnArr[1] = j;
          break;
      }
   }
 }
 
 if(returnArr[0] > returnArr[1]) {
     int temp = returnArr[0];
     
     returnArr[0]=returnArr[1];
     returnArr[1]=temp;
 }
  
 return returnArr;
}  
```

 2. slightly better method. 
 
  - basically, the concept is the same from the above. 
  - But, If you change order of statement, performance is much better.
  - **i.e if you change order of operation, the needless operation disappears**
  

```c
int* twoSum(int* nums, int numsSize, int target) {

 int * returnArr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)*2);
 int i =0, j=0;
 
memset(returnArr, 0 , sizeof(returnArr)); 
 
 for(i = 0 ; i < numsSize ; i++) {
   for(j = numsSize ; j > 0 ; j--) {
   
      if (i == (j-1))
        break; 
      
      if ( (nums[i] + nums[j-1]) == target){
          returnArr[0] = i;
          returnArr[1] = j-1;
          break;
      }
   }
 }
   
 return returnArr;
}  
```  
   memset function is include in <string.h>.
   
   be carfule, 
   
   void* memset(void *str, int c, size_t n) 
   
   value of c is converted into the type of unsigned char, so with that value, this function fills the block of memory.
   
   more details, In [this URL](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_memset.htm)
   
   **in my case, mainly in algorithm competition, I use this function to initialize the memory to 0 or -1**
