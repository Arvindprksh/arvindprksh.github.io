## How to install ag

  On My CentOS 7 
  
  > $ sduo yum install -y epel-release.noarch
  
  > $ sudo yum install -y the_silver_searcher
  
  If you want to know more, just refer to [the_silver_searcher git repository's README](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher/blob/master/README.md)

## For example, In order to search  

  > $ ag "string or regular expression to search" -A 5 -B 5
  
  this means the result of ag is in front 5 line and back 5 line from string that ag find.
